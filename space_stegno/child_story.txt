The Little Dragon Who Found His Roar
Once upon a time, in the magical land of Ember Valley, there lived a little dragon named Sparky. Sparky was no ordinary dragon. While most dragons could breathe fire or roar loudly enough to shake mountains, Sparky could only manage a tiny puff of smoke and a squeaky “rawr.”

The other dragons often teased him. “A dragon who can’t roar?” scoffed Blaze, the biggest and loudest of them all. “You’ll never scare a knight or guard a treasure like that!”

Sparky felt sad but didn’t give up. He spent his days practicing in secret, trying to breathe flames or at least roar a little louder. His best friend, a wise old owl named Olive, always encouraged him.

“One day, Sparky, you’ll find your roar,” said Olive, perching on his shoulder. “But sometimes, it takes more than practice. It takes a reason to roar.”

One bright morning, the peaceful Ember Valley was disturbed by a loud commotion. A mischievous ogre named Grumble had stormed into the village and was stealing all the shiny treasures! Gold coins, sparkling jewels, even the villagers’ cooking pots—he took them all, stuffing them into a giant sack.

The villagers ran to the elder dragons for help, but they were too busy showing off their flames and didn’t pay attention. Sparky knew he had to do something.

“I may not roar like the others,” he said, “but I can’t let Grumble take everything!”

Sparky flew to the ogre’s hideout, a dark and spooky cave on the far side of the valley. Inside, Grumble was admiring his loot and laughing loudly.

“Who’s there?” growled the ogre when he spotted Sparky. “A little dragon? You don’t scare me!”

Sparky felt a flicker of fear but remembered Olive’s words. He stood tall and shouted, “Leave the treasures alone!”

Grumble laughed even harder. “Is that the best you can do? Where’s your roar, little dragon?”

At that moment, Sparky felt something stir deep inside him. It wasn’t anger or fear—it was determination. The thought of helping his village gave him courage. He took a deep breath, and suddenly…

“ROOOOAAAARRR!”

A mighty sound echoed through the cave, shaking the walls and sending pebbles tumbling down. Grumble dropped his sack in shock. Even a small puff of flame burst from Sparky’s nostrils!

“Okay, okay! I’m leaving!” cried the ogre, scrambling away as fast as his big feet could carry him.

Sparky returned to the village with the treasure, greeted by cheers and hugs. The elder dragons, who had laughed at him before, now looked at him with pride.

“You don’t need to be the loudest or the biggest to be brave,” said Olive, winking at Sparky. And from that day on, Sparky was known as the little dragon with the biggest heart—and the loudest roar.
